# AI-Assisted Inventory & Finance System

This project documents how **structured AI prompting and systems thinking**
were used to design, analyze, and improve an inventory and finance
tracking workflow for a small business.

The focus is on **decision support, automation logic, and reliability**—
not model training or ML experimentation.


## Problem Statement

The existing inventory and finance process relied heavily on:
- Manual data entry
- Multiple disconnected sheets
- Human memory for tracking stock movements
- Periodic, error-prone reconciliation

This resulted in:
- Inconsistent inventory counts
- Delayed financial visibility
- Higher risk of human error
